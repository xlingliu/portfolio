# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

## The audience
Initially, my objective was to provide an overview of US agriculture and agricultural trade to individuals who had limited knowledge of the subject.
Now, I have identified my target audience as policy makers in the field of international trade, government officials, and administrators, despite the fact that my report may seem simple and less sophisticated.

## Final design decisions
In Part II of my project, I conducted interviews with three individuals and received valuable feedback on my presentation. The majority of the comments focused on the visualizations, indicating that they were not visually appealing or clear enough. After observing the presentations of my classmates on Monday, I recognized that the biggest issue with my project was the absence of a compelling narrative or call to action. I also realized that my presentation was longer than it should have been. Therefore, I have streamlined my content, sought to create a narrative based on my report, and changed my target audiences. 

Furthermore, I have taken steps to improve the visualizations in my presentation. I have discovered a method to embed Tableau code into Shorthand, which allows for more interactive and appropriately sized visualizations. I have also modified some of the visualizations to make them more informative and intuitive.

# Final thoughts
The reason behind my interest in this topic is my previous summer internship at the World Resources Institute, where I worked with and analyzed agricultural data. For this project, I have utilized the same dataset for my visualizations.

While creating my report, I faced several difficulties, primarily related to visualizations and storytelling. During Part I, I sketched out the visualizations I intended to use and attempted to recreate them using Tableau in Part II. Unfortunately, I was not able to replicate the exact visualizations I had envisioned, and I had to adjust and find new visualization forms. Fortunately, the final visualizations turned out to be visually appealing and effective. Another challenge I encountered was developing a compelling story from my report and making it concise enough to fit within the presentation's time constraints, as I mentioned earlier.
