# About me
Hi, my name is Xiangling Liu(She/Her). I am a graduate student in Carnegie Mellon University's Public Policy & Management program and I will be graduating in May 2023. 

# What I hope to learn
I've had quite some experience with data visualization before this course. And I hope after this course I can be an expert in data visualization. I am currently seeking a job as Data Analyst/Data Scientist.
